File templates and info used to write this .md file from https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2#file-readme-template-md and https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock.

## Prerequisites
This extension was tested during development in Google Chrome. Run this in Chrome for best results.

Research suggests that it may be possible to install and run this extension in Firefox per https://www.howtogeek.com/233355/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store-and-firefox-add-ons-gallery/. I have not yet tested this case and in case I end up doing so, I will update this project with the results.

## Installation
Download and unzip the zipped file, then, follow Google instructions for installing the extension at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.
