While the extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store, research suggests that it may be possible to install and run the extension in Firefox per https://www.howtogeek.com/233355/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store-and-firefox-add-ons-gallery/. I have not yet tested this case and in case I end up doing so, I will update this project with the results.
